# Customer-Segmentation
Problem statement: In this inquire about, we look at a value-based dataset from a UK-based retailer that's open at the UCI Machine Learning Store in arrange to pick up a careful understanding of the booming field of online retail. This dataset records each exchange that took put between 2010 and 2011. The most goal is to utilize customer division to extend promoting tactics' adequacy and deals. By creating extra highlights that will make it simpler to isolate clients into discrete bunches utilizing the K-means clustering technique, we trust to turn the value-based information into a dataset that's centered on desires of the client. We are going be able to comprehend the different profiles and inclinations of different client bunches much obliged to this segmentation. Expanding on this, we arrange to make a suggestion motor that will advance best-selling items to customers in each category who haven't bought them however, thus expanding promoting viability and driving up deals. 
Objectives: 
 Information Change & Cleaning: Get ready the dataset for productive clustering by expelling exceptions, copies, and lost values. By making a client-centric dataset through highlight designing, you will lay 
  the basis for client division by making unused highlights based on value-based information.
 Information preprocessing: Disentangle the information by lessening its dimensionality and scaling its highlights. This will make strides the clustering process's effectiveness.
 Client Division with K-Means Clustering: Utilize K-Means to separate your client base into discrete bunches for more individualized showcasing campaigns.
 Cluster Investigation and Assessment: Look at and profile each cluster to form centered promoting plans and gage the caliber of the clusters that were made.
 Proposal Framework: To extend deals and marketing efficacy, put in put a framework that proposes top-selling things to clients within the same cluster who haven't bought them.
